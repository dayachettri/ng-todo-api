# Introduction

The TODO API is a RESTful API that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks and categories. This API provides an interface for managing tasks and categories for a user.

## Technologies

The API is built with Node.js, and the Hapi.js framework is used to handle server creation and routing. The API uses PostgreSQL as the database management system, and the Knex.js library as the SQL query builder. The Objection.js library is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database access. The JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication scheme is used to authenticate user requests.

## Requirements

- Node.js version 14.0 or higher installed
- PostgreSQL database installed and running
- `.env` file with the following variables:
  - DB_HOST
  - DB_PORT
  - DB_NAME
  - DB_USER
  - DB_PASSWORD
  - JWT_SECRET
  - PORT (optional)
  - HOST (optional)

## Usage

The API has the following endpoints:

### User Management

- `POST /signup`: Creates a new user account.
- `POST /login`: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.

### Category Management

- `GET /categories`: Returns a list of all categories.
- `POST /categories`: Creates a new category.
- `PUT /categories/{id}`: Updates a category by ID.
- `DELETE /categories/{id}`: Deletes a category by ID.

### Task Management

- `GET /categories/{categoryid}/tasks`: Returns a list of tasks for a given category.
- `GET /tasks/{id}`: Returns a task by ID.
- `POST /tasks`: Creates a new task.
- `PUT /tasks/{id}`: Updates a task by ID.
- `DELETE /tasks/{id}`: Deletes a task by ID.

### Authentication

JWT tokens are required to access the protected endpoints. The token should be included in the Authorization header of each request with the format Bearer {token}.
